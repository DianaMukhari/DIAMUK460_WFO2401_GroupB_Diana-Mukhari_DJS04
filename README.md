This JavaScript code is a part of a web application designed to display a collection of books, allowing users to browse and filter them by genre and author. Initially, it imports book data, authors, genres, and a constant representing the number of books per page from a data.js file. A Book class is defined to create book objects, encapsulating properties like ID, title, author, description, publication date, image, and genres. Arrays of book, author, and genre objects are created using the provided data. Functions are defined to render book previews, filter options, and manage various interactions, such as opening and closing overlays and submitting forms.

The code also includes initialization and event listeners for interacting with the webpage. It renders the initial set of books and filter options into designated containers, adjusts the theme based on user preferences, and manages pagination with a "Show more" button. Event listeners handle the opening and closing of search and settings overlays, form submissions for filtering books, and changing the display theme. When a book preview is clicked, detailed information about the selected book is displayed in an overlay. This setup ensures a responsive and interactive user interface for browsing and managing a large collection of books.

lastly, i created separate web componernts (book preview and data seach).
